The internet has redefined the manner in which media is distributed. 
Even with the increase in image, audio and particularly video data available the majority of media outlets still dispense information in the form of written text. 
Authors both pride and depend on their work, they may wish to see it protected and have direct control over its distribution.
Watermarking is a data protection technique which embeds the protection information within the host data. 
It does not necessarily restrict access to the desired information, but marks it as the property of its rightful owner. 
Typically applied in copyright enforcement, this technique can be extended to data tracking. 
Natural language watermarking sees the watermark embedded within the language itself, independent of the format of a text. 
It could spell the end of the online book piracy which has run many a book out of publication.
Few techniques have been developed for natural language watermarking and even the literature is scarce. 
However, Atallah et al. (2001) designed a prototype scheme in which the watermark is embedded directly within the syntactic structure of a language. 
This report attempts to introduce the relevant information required to recreate such a prototype.
